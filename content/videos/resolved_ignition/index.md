The flexibility of AREPO allows us to do funny things like increase the resolution locally, so I decided to follow the region where the helium ignition takes place in our double-detonation simulations, increasing the resolution in such that we have cells with radii of just a couple hundred meters.\
The result is this stunning simulation.\
