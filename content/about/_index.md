I'm Javier Moran Fraile, a PhD student in physics.
I was born in Spain where I lived and studied until I graduated from my BSc in Physics in the University of Valladolid in 2017.
Afterwards I started my international journey by moving to The Netherlands and taking a MSc in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam, working with Dr. S. E. de Mink.

Since September 2019 I am a PhD student working with Prof. F. Roepke in the [Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/ "HITS"), working on three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of stellar binary interactions, such as common-envelope events, stellar mergers, and merger-induced thermonuclear explosions.
